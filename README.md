# Photographic-Filter
This code was written in C and applies a filter onto an image.ppm file based on the specified kernel. </br>
</br>
For example the kernel: </br>
-1 -1 -1 </br>
-1  8 -1 </br>
-1 -1 -1 </br> </br>
Produced a filter on the following image: </br>
</br>
![flower.jpg](flower.jpg)
</br>
![output.jpg](output.jpg) </br>
Other output files are provided in the repository displaying different kernels resulting in different filters.
The example images were taken from the following websites: </br>
